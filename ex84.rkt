;Exercise 34. Design the function string-first, which extracts the first character from a non-empty string. Donâ€™t worry about empty strings. 

;Exercise 35. Design the function string-last, which extracts the last character from a non-empty string. 

;Exercise 36. Design the function image-area, which counts the number of pixels in a given image. 

;Exercise 37. Design the function string-rest, which produces a string like the given one with the first character removed. 

;Exercise 38. Design the function string-remove-last, which produces a string like the given one with the last character removed.
